### üß† DeepLearning-TensorFLowFruits üçé

This project is developed using TensorFlow Keras with the aim of studying deep learning and taking the initial steps in this field. Initially, a Kaggle Dataset containing some sample images of fruits was utilized. To expand the dataset, additional samples were obtained from Google Images using the Fatkun extension. Data augmentation techniques were also applied to enhance the sample images.

The architecture of the neural network is built upon Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), incorporating techniques like Dropout to prevent overfitting.
